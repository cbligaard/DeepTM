**Welcome to the repository for the DeepTM project!**
This project revolved around making a deep learning model for prediction of protein transmembrane helices. The overall goal was to create a model that takes an amino acid sequence as an input and predicts the protein topology (i.e. which amino acid residues are positioned where relative to the membrane). 
There are five categories for each residue:<br> 
1. Membrane in-out
1. Membrane out-in
1. Signal peptide
1. Inside
1. Outside
